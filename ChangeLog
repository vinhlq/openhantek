* Version 0.1.0 - First public release:
* OpenGL accelerated scope
* Custom widgets for level sliders (Offset, trigger, ...)
* Markers and a zoom option that enables a second magnified scope
* Basic export/print functionality
* Fully customizable colors for screen/print
* Spectrum graphs with selectable window function
* Tables around scopes viewing settings and measurement results
* Configurable digital phosphor mode
* Experimental fast rate and large buffer mode
* German translation

2010-07-10  Oliver Haag  <oliver.haag@gmail.com>
* Replaced HantekDSOIO and HantekDSOAThread by DsoControl class
* New namespace Hantek (in directory src/hantek):
*   Added Control class (Inherits DsoControl)
*   Moved all Hantek DSO specific conversions into Control class
*   Added Device class for handling usb transfers
*   Created types.cpp/types.h with various Hantek-specific types
*   USB transfers are handled by Control class, no direct access from elsewhere
*   libusb 1.0 is used by default (Uses 0.1 when LIBUSB_VERSION is set to 0)
* DsoControl class could control non-Hantek DSOs too
* Added reference level and minimum magnitude for spectrum analysis to settings
* Made lower timebases available
* Spectrum and math graphs can be shown without enabling the voltage graph too
